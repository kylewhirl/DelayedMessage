## Date Examples
You can format dates in many different ways. Some examples:
* Today at 4 pm
* Tomorrow at noon
* March 24, 4:14 am
* Mar 24, 4:14:30 AM
* 4 pm
* Today

Some important notes:
* If you do not specify am/pm, then it will default to pm
* If you only specify a time, it will send at the next occurrence of that time
* If you do not specify a time, it will default to 12:00 PM
