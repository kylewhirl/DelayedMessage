## How to Use
The shortcut has many different options, but the easiest method is to choose: 
* "Select Contacts" -> Select your contacts -> Select date & time -> Type message -> Wait for the notification

After you have set up your message, you will receive a notification at the date and time you specified. When you click this notification, the text will be sent automatically.
